# Raw data files
All derived producs should be made by scripts saved in `/code/`, invoked by `run_all.R`, and saved in the appropriate output directory in `/outputs/`  
derived data products which take too long to process or have antecedent datasets  which are very large should be saved here, but the code/steps used to create them should be documented very clearly and explicitly
