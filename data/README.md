# Raw data files
Raw data files used for analysis
All derived products used in analysis are made by scripts saved in `/code/`, which are invoked by `run_all.R`. Derived data are saved in the appropriate output directory in `/outputs/`  
Derived data products which take too long to process or have very large antecedent datasets are saved here with clear documentation of the code/steps used to create them
